Or to run sync and fetch locally, you could set up a crontab like so:

    *  *  * * * cd /home/chbrown/src/divvy-history && ./fetch
    0 */6 * * * cd /home/chbrown/src/divvy-history && ./sync


* `fetch` should run every minute
* `sync` can run however often you like. The above crontab will run it every six hours.
